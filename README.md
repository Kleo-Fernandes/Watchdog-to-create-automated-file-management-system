# Python Automated File Management System

This Python script is designed to **organize, track, and back up files** in a specified directory. It uses the **[`watchdog`](https://pypi.org/project/watchdog/)** library to monitor file system events like creation, modification, deletion, and movement in real-time.

---

## Key Features

Automatically organizes files based on naming convention into year and month subfolders.  
Creates backups of original files in a designated backup folder.  
Detects and handles modified files by moving them to a separate folder and restoring the original from backup.  
Logs all file system events to the console in real-time.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. Monitors a specified folder for file system events.
2. Processes files starting with `GF` and having a length of 12 characters.
3. Extracts the year and month from the file name to categorize files.
4. Manages and backs up modified files automatically.

---

> **Note:**  
This script is highly customizable for other naming conventions or workflows. Update folder paths inside the script before running. The script will run continuously until manually stopped.

# Run Watchdog Management Project on Boot (Windows)

This guide explains how to **run `Watchdog_Management_Project.py` automatically on Windows startup using a `.bat` file placed in the Startup folder**.

## Steps

### 1Ô∏è. Create a Batch File

1. Open **Notepad**.
2. Paste the following, replacing with your actual Python executable and script paths:

    ```batch
    @echo off
    "C:\Path\To\Python\python.exe" "C:\Path\To\Watchdog_Management_Project.py"
    ```

    **Example:**

    ```batch
    @echo off
    "C:\Users\kleo\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\python.exe" "C:\Users\kleo\Documents\Watchdog_Management_Project.py"
    ```

3. Save the file as:

    ```
    launch_watchdog_project.bat
    ```

---

### 2Ô∏è. Add the Batch File to the Startup Folder

1. Press:

    ```
    Win + R
    ```

2. Type:

    ```
    shell:startup
    ```

3. Press **Enter** to open the Startup folder.

4. Copy your `launch_watchdog_project.bat` file into this folder.

---

Now, your **Watchdog Management Project will automatically run every time you log in to Windows**.
